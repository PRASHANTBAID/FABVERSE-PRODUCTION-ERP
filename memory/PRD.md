# FABVERSE - Garment Production ERP

## Overview
Single-user ERP system for garment production tracking through stages: Cutting → Stitching → Bartack → Washing/Dyeing

## Problem Statement
Build a single-user garment production ERP app called "FABVERSE" that digitizes Excel and ERP notes for all production stages, generates challans for outsourced work, and enforces date validation.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TailwindCSS, Shadcn/UI components
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with async MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Auth**: JWT-based single admin user (admin/admin)

## User Personas
- **Admin**: Single administrator managing entire production pipeline

## Core Requirements
1. ✅ Single admin login (admin/admin)
2. ✅ Cutting module with rolls table, fabric calculations
3. ✅ Stitching module with auto-increment challan (ST-XXX)
4. ✅ Bartack module
5. ✅ Washing/Dyeing module with auto-increment challan (W-XXX)
6. ✅ Dashboard with pipeline visualization
7. ✅ Color-coded status (Green=Completed, Yellow=In Progress)
8. ✅ Notes per stage (visible on challans)
9. ✅ Challan generation with print/PDF download
10. ✅ Bartack person name on washing challan
11. ✅ Excel import/export
12. ✅ Reports & Analytics
13. ✅ Change password functionality
14. ✅ Date validation (no past dates for future-oriented fields)
